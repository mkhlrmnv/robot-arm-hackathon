# robot-arm-hackathon

# Introduction
This is project about building 2D robot arm using Arduino Uno. Arm is two degrees of freedom and grapper on the end that everything is controller by servo motors. 
Arm is being moved by computer vision that detects humans hand and gives arm signals accordingly. Also calculating distance between index and thumb fingers to control grapper. This is powered by Python and Google's Mediapipe ML, that is being run on the laptop and then sent by usb cable to Arduino.
